A \emph{locally presentable category} (or just \emph{presentable} category) is a
category which is not too big and not too small: it is cocomplete, but is the
generated by a small set of objects.
The main reference for this beast is \cite{adamek_rosicky}.


A morphism between presentable categories is defined as cocontinuous functor in
Anel's and Joyal's Topo-logie.

Presentable categories can be defined as
cocomplete \emph{accessible categories}, or as complete accessible categories
(after nlab, the page on accessible categories and locally presentable categories).

An accessible category is defined as a $\lambda$-accessible category (you don't
need to know what it is at this stage) for some
regular cardinal $\lambda$. This a notion of $\lambda$-presentable category, and
a presentable categories is a $\lambda$-presentable category, for some regular
cardinal $\lambda$. Any $\lambda$-presentable category is also $\mu$-presentable
for any regular cardinal $\mu>\lambda$ (this is not the case for accessible categories!).


Presentable categories satisfy nice properties.

\begin{definition}
 A functor is said \textbf{accessible}  if it is \textbf{$\lambda$-accessible}
 for some regular cardinal $\lambda$, that is, if it
  preserves $\lambda$-directed colimits.
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
  \cite[1.66]{adamek_rosicky}
  A functor between presentable categories is right adjoint iff it is continuous
  and accessible.
  \end{theorem}
  A similar statement is true of left adjointness, according to nlab.
  \begin{theorem}[nlab]
   Let $T$  be an accessible monad on a presentable category $C$.
   Then $C^T$ is presentable.
  \end{theorem}

  \section{Presentable categories}
  Let $\lambda$ be a regular cardinal. A $\lambda$-presentable category is a
  category $C$ which is a free $\lambda$-cocompletion
  $\Cont\lambda(\Pres\lambda(C))$ of
  some full subcategory $\Pres\lambda(C)$ of \emph{$\lambda$-presentable objects}.

  Here, by free $\lambda$-cocompletion, we think informally of an adjunction between
  cocomplete (not $\lambda$-cocomplete!) categories and the category of
  categories and $\lambda$-cocontinous functors (i.e., functors preserving any
  $\lambda$-small colimit, not only the directed ones).

\section{Finitely presentable categories}
Any presheaf category is finitely presentable \cite{adamek_rosicky}: the
representable functors form the strong generator, and thus the presentable
objects are the finite limits of these representable functors.

\section{Gabriel-Ulmer}
This section is based on Exercise 1.s and Remark 1.46 of \cite{adamek_rosicky}.

\begin{theorem}
  For each regular cardinal $\lambda$, we denote
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 
  $c_{\lambda}CAT$ the category of
small categories $\lambda$-complete and functor preserving these limits;
\item $lp_{\lambda}CAT$ the category of $\lambda$-presentable categories and
  continuous and $\lambda$-accessible functors.
  \end{itemize}
Then, the following functors are equivalences:
\begin{align*}
 R : c_{\lambda}CAT & \rightarrow lp_{\lambda}CAT
  \\
  C & \mapsto \Cont\lambda C^o
      \\
 L : lp_{\lambda}CAT& \rightarrow c_{\lambda}CAT 
  \\
  C & \mapsto \Pres\lambda(C)^o
\end{align*}
\end{theorem}
Actually, they even induce a biequivalence ($c_{\lambda}CAT$ and
$lp_{\lambda}CAT$ can be equipped with a 2-categorical structure).
\begin{question}
 Is it a strict 2-equivalence? I guess no, otherwise it would have been said. 
\end{question}

This theorem induces two (equivalent) contravariant functors
from the poset of regular cardinals (seen
as a category) to the category of small categories. Performing the Grothendieck construction yield
an equivalence between some category of presentable categories and some category
of small categories (fibered over the
category of regular cardinals).
\section{Sketches}
\begin{definition}
 A \textbf{sketch} is a small category $C$ with a family of (small) diagrams $F_i : D_i
 \to C$ together with a choice of a cone or a cocone for each of this diagram.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
  The \textbf{category of models of a sketch $(C,(F_i,c_i)_i)$} is the full
  subcategory of $[C,\Set]$ mapping any mapping any chosen cones and cocones to
  limits and colimits.
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
 Any accessible category is equivalent to the category of models of a sketch.
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}
 Any presentable category is equivalent to the category of models of a
 \textbf{limit sketch}, that is, a sketch with only cones (and no cocones).
\end{theorem}
\begin{question}
 How do you retrieve the regular cardinal from this description? Probably, it is
some cardinal bound over the size of the diagrams?
\end{question}
\begin{theorem}
  (nlab)
 A  category is $\lambda$-accessible iff it is equivalent to a full subcategory
 of a presheaf category closed under $\lambda$-filtered colimits.
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}
 A category is if it is equivalent to a reflective subcategory
 of a presheaf category.
\end{theorem}
Note that a $\lambda$-accessible category is a $\lambda$-presentable
in case the embedding into the presheaf category has a left adjoint.
% Hence, for presentable category, we get a left adjoint to the embedding into the
% category of presheaf
\begin{theorem}
  \cite[Corollary 2.62]{adamek_rosicky}
  For any sketch, there exists another one whose cones/cocones are all
  limiting/colimiting and has an equivalent category of models.
\end{theorem}
By Gabriel-Ulmer duality, we already know that for limit sketches: you can
take the $\lambda$-complete category corresponding to the presentable category
and take all the $\lambda$-small limits as cones.
\begin{question}
 What does exactly this construction on a sketch $S$ do? 
 % I have noted somewhere that it is given by the factorization of  $S\to
 % \Set^{S}\to Mod(S)$
 % where the last functor is the loù la dernière flèche est l'adjoint à gauche de l'inclusion de Mod dans Set^{S}. L'inclusion de S dans ce sketch réalisant est alors l'identité sur les objets.
\end{question}
\section{GATs and EATs}
generalized algebraic theories (or gats) are defined in \cite{CARTMELL}, and
also more formally (and recently) in \cite{combinatorial-structure}


\subsection{QIITs are (particular) GATs}
It is not exactly clear what are GATs introduced by \cite{CARTMELL}, in particular what is the status of
equations of sorts.
GATs are like QIITs but with a possible infinite context. More concretely, a GAT
consists of a possibly infinite set of axiomatic judgments, and each judgement must be
wellformed (with respect to a finite subset of axioms).
Infinitary QIITs allow to capture some of them, but not all.
\begin{question}
Can we find a
counter example?
\end{question}

Also, in QIITs, we can have equality constructors taking equalities in
arguments, that we cannot do directly with GATs. But fortunately, such constructors can be encoded
by introducing new types in the universe which are the limits of other ones
(such incorporating the equations).
\begin{question}
\cite{CARTMELL}  claims that GATs are equivalent to EATs, but how to deal with
equations of sorts? How are they converted in the EAT version ?
\end{question}
Cartmell also proves
that they are equivalent to contextual categories, and for this he needs these
sorts equations
(see (iii) at the
top of p107 of his PhD manuscript).

Taichi sees two difficulties when trying to replace sort
equations with isomorphisms:
\begin{itemize}
\item If we replace a sort equation $A = B$ with a sort isomorphism $e : A \simeq B$, we also have to replace occurences of coercion along $A = B$ with
  applications of $e$.
  \item A naive replacement can create a different GAT. For
  example, consider the GAT consisting of a constant sort A and equation $A = A$
  (although this equation is redundant, it is a valid GAT). A model of
  $(A, A = A)$ is just a set, but a model of $(A, e : A \simeq A)$ is a set equipped with an
  automorphism. They do not seem to be equivalent.
\end{itemize}
I expect that 1. is possible, although I confess I don't know how to
do it in general.
For the second point, I would suggest the
following: given any sort equation $A = A$ that you can prove in the
theory induced by a GAT with sort equations, you get (I hope) an
automorphism on the translation of $A$ (in the translated GAT which
turns sort equations into isomorphisms). Then,  for each such sort
equation, add in the translated GAT that this automorphism should be
the identity.
\subsection{QIITs are QITs (as GATs are EATs)}
Example:
$Con:\U, Ty:Con\to\U$ is translated as $ Con:\U,\int Ty : \U, con : \int Ty\to
Con$ (this is the idea of translating GATs into EATS, as in \cite{CARTMELL}).
\begin{question}
  Maybe this generalizes to HIITs and HITs?
\end{question}
