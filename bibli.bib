abstract = "We give an account of the basic combinatorial structure underlying the notion of type dependency. We do so by considering the category of generalised algebraic theories in the sense of Cartmell, and exhibiting it as the category of algebras for a monad on a presheaf category. The objects of the presheaf category encode the basic judgements of a dependent sequent calculus, while the action of the monad encodes the deduction rules; so by giving an explicit description of the monad, we obtain an explicit account of the combinatorics of type dependency. We find that this combinatorics is controlled by a particular kind of decorated ordered tree, familiar from computer science and from innocent game semantics. Furthermore, we find that the monad at issue is of a particularly well-behaved kind: it is local right adjoint in the sense of Street–Weber. In future work, we will use this fact to describe nerves for dependent type theories, and to study the coherence problem for dependent type theory using the tools of two-dimensional monad theory."

abstract = "For a suitable collection D of small categories, we define the D-accessible categories, generalizing the λ-accessible categories of Lair, Makkai, and Paré; here the λ-accessible categories are seen as the D-accessible categories where D consists of the λ-small categories. A small category C is called D-filtered when C-colimits commute with D-limits in the category of sets. An object of a category is called D-presentable when the corresponding representable functor preserves D-filtered colimits. The D-accessible categories are then the categories with D-filtered colimits and a small set of D-presentable objects which is “dense with respect to D-filtered colimits”. We suppose always that D satisfies a technical condition called “soundness”: this is the “suitable” case mentioned above. Every D-accessible category is accessible; thus the choice of different sound D provides a classification of accessible categories, as referred to in the title. A surprising number of the main results from the theory of accessible categories remain valid in the D-accessible context. The locally D-presentable categories are defined as the cocomplete D-accessible categories. When D consists of the finite categories, these are precisely the locally finitely presentable categories of Gabriel and Ulmer. When D consists of the finite discrete categories, these are the finitary varieties. As a by-product of this theory, we prove that the free completion under D-filtered colimits distributes over the free completion under limits. This result is new, even in the case where D is empty and D-filtered colimits are just arbitrary (small) colimits."
